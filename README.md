# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Python

This program prints a game of rock, paper, scissors played between the computer and a human player, who plays their next move after reading a printed prompt asking them how they want to proceed (either r, p, s, or q). If the user enters "q", the game ends. Each round, a line is printed indicating what was played and who won. At the end of the game, total game statistics are printed.
